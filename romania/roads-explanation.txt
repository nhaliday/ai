The first line of the roads.txt file is the length of the node numbers. This
will be referred to as 'zfill'.

Note that this data is adapted from Census Bureau data; I can't vouch for its
accuracy. In the course of working with it, I have observed: non-numeric
addresses, address or zip code slots completely filled with whitespace,
multiple road segments claiming the same address range, bike trails (the W&OD
specifically) marked as roads, etc. The Census Feature Code mentioned is
described in full at the Tiger-Line technical documentation at
'http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tiger2006se/TGR06SE.pdf'; it provides
information about the type of road. BE WARNED: THIS IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE.
